CIS4301-Project-GUL
===================

Gainesville Utilities Lookup, project for CIS4301.

A Nice Workflow
----------

* Create a new branch (from master usually) for a feature

``` git checkout -b newbranch ```
* Implement the feature on this branch
* When done implementing make a github Pull Request to merge it back in
*If there is not more work to do or no point in keeping it,
    delete the branch, too
